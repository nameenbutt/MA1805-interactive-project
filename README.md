My project is an interactive digital artwork that explores how facial-recognition systems misidentify, distort, or entirely fail to read women and people of colour. Instead of detecting a face, the interface generates drifting green boxes, flickering labels, and unstable readings such as "Unknown", "Access Denied", and "Loading...". These errors are not technical glitches: they stand in for the real experiences of people whose identities fall outside the datasets that contemporary facial-recognition systems are trained to recognise. 

My code tries to create a sense of misrecognition, for example, in every frame, a new box appears and shakes as if it is unsure of what it is looking for, and then it disappears. I also included stanlines and static noise to show interference in the system, meaning there is no stable reading - only futile attempts. By adding this, the interface feels restless, as though it is searching for a face that refuses to match its limited expectations.

Although the sketch never analyses a real face, it behaves like a system that has already decided someone does not fit. By replacing accuracy with uncertainty, the piece highlights the gap between being present snd being legible to technology. overall, my project encourages viewers to consider what it means when a machine cannot recognise you, and what is lost when visibility is filtered through biased code.
